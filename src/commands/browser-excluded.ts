 * List of commands that are not available in browser environments.
 *
 * These commands are excluded from the browser bundle because they:
 * - Use Node.js-specific APIs that don't have browser equivalents
 * - Have dependencies that don't work in browsers
 *
 * Note: sqlite3 is opt-in (requires `sqlite: true` option) so it's not
 * listed here - it will show "command not found" like any other unknown command.
 *
 * When a user tries to use one of these commands in a browser environment,
 * they should get a helpful error message explaining why the command
 * is not available.
